Description:
     Cannot type in new terminal, but can type in terminal 1
Solution:
     Because the first shell is open in the kernel function while the shell in other terminals are open by "alt+shift"(in keyboard handler). When we press "alt+shift", we will go to the new terminal and open a new shell. But the shell is a infinite loop, which means we can never get the eoi of "alt+shift" and we cannot use keyboard anymore.
      The solution is to add send_eoi at the begining of the keyboard handler.

Description:
     The cursor of the display terminal change with the screen_x, screen_y position in backtage termianl.
Solution:
     We only change the screen_x, screen_y when the scheduled terminal is the display terminal. If not, we change the cursor position in the terminal structure by a new function.
