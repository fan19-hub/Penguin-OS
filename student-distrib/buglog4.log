                          BUG 1                          
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Time:
    2022.4.13.
Creator:

Description:
     when we check syserr, we could not pass the 6th test, which is vidmap test.
Solution:
   We check the vidmap part of syserr , and it shows fail happens when the input address is not checked. Then we find we use screenstart as the address, which is avtually
**screenstart so our check is useless. Then we check whether **screenstart is between 128MB and 132MB, and it worked.

                          BUG 2                          
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Time:
    2022.4.14.
Creator:

Description:
   After send fish command , nothing showes and all functions except vidmap is well implemented.
Solution:
   We thought problem is in vidmap.And finally, we find we check whether *screenstart is NULL , if it is NULL , then return.
Because *screenstart store a physical address which can be NULL, and fact shows it is exactly NULL so we do not execute the function body and return -1.
We delete this check, and everything is well. 



    Then problem solved.
